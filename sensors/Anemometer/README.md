![image-removebg-preview](https://github.com/cyberdebb/estacao_meteorologica/assets/107296659/e26fc378-fd3a-42bb-86ed-dd05aaa47658)

The Arduino Anemometer is an electronic device, also known as a wind sensor, developed to measure wind speed in projects involving microcontroller platforms such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

It is a cup-type anemometer, offering excellent performance for wind measurement, as well as greater resistance to external agents, since the cups are made of high-durability aluminum.

The connection to the microcontroller system is simple, as it uses only two wires and can be electrically installed in three different ways (wiring diagrams available for download below). It must be connected to a digital input of the microcontroller.

Highly functional, the fixed Arduino Anemometer is used in greenhouses, monitored environmental protection areas, weather stations, ports, agricultural areas, among other environments.

Its operating parameters are wide, as the wind sensor can measure wind speeds from 0 to 33.33 m/s — that’s right, an impressive 120 km/h.

It allows mounting on a tube with a diameter of up to 35 mm using its fixing support.

It also features high precision and good stability, comes factory-calibrated, includes a reed switch sensor, and provides a strong level of anti-interference protection, making it ready to be connected directly to Arduino.
