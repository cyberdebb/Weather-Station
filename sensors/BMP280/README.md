The [BMP280 Pressure and Temperature Sensor](https://datasheets.eletrogate.com/BMP280.pdf) is the newest version of the BMP180. It provides improvements in terms of accuracy and power consumption, in addition to being 63% smaller, which makes it widely used in mobile and portable devices.

This module features a built-in temperature sensor, reducing the number of components and connections required in your project. In addition, it operates using I2C or SPI interfaces and a 3 V supply voltage. Its low power consumption allows long-term operation when powered by batteries, making it suitable for projects such as drones, weather stations, GPS-enabled devices, watches, and more.
